## Introduction

The Quiz Game in C Project is designed to provide users with an engaging quiz experience.

- **Feedback**: After each question, the player receives immediate feedback on whether their answer was correct or not.

- **File Handling**: Questions and answers are stored in external text files, allowing easy modification and expansion of the question database.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using C programming language features:

- **Functions**: Different functions are used to handle category selection, question presentation, answer validation, and score calculation.

- **File I/O**: Questions and answers are read from external text files using file input operations.

- **Looping**: Loops are used to iterate through questions, display options, and manage user interaction.
